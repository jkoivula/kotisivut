PORTFOLIO:
Here are the projects I have participated in. Most of these, in fact all of these are final projects of particular courses.

Webkehitys: Web-development

//desc: This website was created as our 
Web development course final project. The website is for
a make-believe company called Moon Travels that offers
trips to different locations around the Solar System.
<br>
We build the the website design using web techniques such as HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. We also added some functionality to the navigation bar by using jQuery.
Using PHP we created the websites multiple language options, functioning 'Make an offer'-form that sends the offers to our MySQL database and an admistrator view for managing made offers.
<br>
Moon Travels website was created by Joni Koivula, Pasi Pahkuri and (Aku-Ville Räsänen).

Ohjelmistokehitys: Software development

//desc:
Kurssin lopputyö on luoda webaplikaatio java kielellä käyttäen
spring mvc frameworkia.
Sovellukseen piti luoda: (etsi vaatimukset, crud yms)
Vietiin herokuun ja käytettiin postgresql.
Sovellus on vain suomeksi.

This web application was the final project of Software Development course.
The web application is a simple member register and it was created using Java
programming language and Spring MVC framework, specifically Springboot, and PostgreSQL database.
Requirements for the final project was to implement basic CRUD functionalities to the member register
application and create a REST interface.
Finally the web application was imported to Heroku platform, where anyone can view and try the application for themselves.

I completed the Software Development course // iltaopintoina muiden päiväopintojen ohella.
I created this web application by myself.
Memeber register web application is only available in <b>finnish</b> language.

Mobile Game Programming Fundamentals:

//desc:
Peli oli kesäkurssin lopputyö, focus.
Kurssilla luotiin mobiilipeli Corona SDK IDE*, jonka
ohjelmointikieli on Lua. kaikki pelin koodi on lua kielellä.
Kuvaile millainen peli on.
Minä tein.

/// ENGL:
This project was the main focus of a Mobile Game Programming Fundamentals summer course.
During the summer course we needed to create a simple mobile game of any genre, using Corona SDK framework.
The mobile game was programmed completely with Lua.

My game is an endless runner. Goal of the game is to platform the character across the level successfully by
controlling the jumping function. Game levels are randomly generated, making the exprience different everytime.
The game randomly generates how many platforms are on the stage, how wide and high they are (this is done for each idividual platform)
 and how far apart from each other they are.

I created this mobile game by myself.
